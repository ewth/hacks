# Hacks
These are scripts, dotfiles, aliases and other bits and pieces I use to make development work easier, prettier, or just cooler.

This isn't really intended for public consumption but feel free to have a delve nonetheless. I put it in git so I can access it everywhere and I include this readme because _someone_ will end up having a gander.

#### Thanks
Most of the dotfiles have been passed around by developers with concepts borrowed from all over the show.
I copied my original set entirely from https://github.com/erfanimani so big thanks to Erfan for that.
